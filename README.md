#Quaily
Quaily is a small social media app, of a slightly different kind. Instead of posting pictures that don't correspond to reality, Quaily lets users ask each other a question once a day to find out more about their friends and build a real and deeper social bond.

!!The app is still early in development as it is a hobby solo project!!!
